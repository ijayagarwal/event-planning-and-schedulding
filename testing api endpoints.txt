To test the API endpoints we have to do program like mentioned below for login , Registering a user, 
create an event etc.


To test the API endpoints, you can use tools like Postman or curl:

Register a user:

curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users/register \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"name":"John Doe","email":"john@example.com","password":"password123","role":"organizer"}'

Login:
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/users/login \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"email":"john@example.com","password":"password123"}'

Create an event (use the token received from login):
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/events \
-H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN_HERE" \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"title":"Business Conference","startDate":"2024-01-01","endDate":"2024-01-02","budget":5000}'
